The **Smart Study Companion** is an AI-powered learning assistant designed to help students **study smarter, not harder**.  
Built with **Google AI Studio**, it takes your notes, textbooks, or uploaded PDFs and automatically:

✅ Summarizes key concepts  
✅ Explains difficult topics  
✅ Generates personalized quizzes and flashcards  

Students can chat naturally with the AI to clarify doubts, request examples, or even create short study guides before exams. Over time, the companion adapts to each user’s learning style — identifying weak areas, tracking progress, and suggesting focused revision plans.

## 💡 Why It Stands Out

Smart Study Companion isn’t just another chatbot — it’s a focused, student-friendly study partner.  
It uses large language models to **turn scattered notes into structured, interactive learning experiences**.  

Perfect for:
- 🎓 High school and college students  
- 📚 Self-learners mastering new topics  
- 🧩 Anyone who wants to make studying efficient and enjoyable
